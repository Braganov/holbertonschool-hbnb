# HBNB Documentation in English

## Summary of Tasks for the HBnB Evolution Technical Documentation

### General Objective

Create a comprehensive technical documentation to define the architecture and design of the HBnB Evolution application, a simplified version of Airbnb. This documentation will serve as a reference for development phases.

---

## 1. High-Level Diagram (Package Diagram)

ðŸ“Œ **Objective**: Represent the three-layer architecture of the application and show the communication between these layers via the facade model.

âœ… **To Do**:

- Define the three main layers:
  - **Presentation Layer** (Services, API)
  - **Business Logic Layer** (Models: User, Place, Review, Amenity)
  - **Persistence Layer** (Database)
- Illustrate the relationships between these layers in UML (e.g., with Mermaid.js, draw.io).
- Add explanatory notes on each layer and the role of the facade model.

---

## 2. Detailed Class Diagram (Class Diagram)

ðŸ“Œ **Objective**: Model the main business logic entities in UML.

âœ… **To Do**:

- Define the following classes with their attributes and methods:
  - **User** (name, email, password, admin or notâ€¦)
  - **Place** (title, description, price, latitude, longitude, list of amenitiesâ€¦)
  - **Review** (rating, comment, associated user, associated placeâ€¦)
  - **Amenity** (name, descriptionâ€¦)
- Add relationships between classes (associations, inheritance, compositions).
- Include unique identifiers and creation/update timestamps.
- Write an explanatory note on each entity and its interactions.

---

## 3. Sequence Diagrams

ðŸ“Œ **Objective**: Show the interaction between layers (API, business logic, database) for several actions.

âœ… **To Do**:
Create UML sequence diagrams for 4 key APIs:

1. User registration
2. Creation of a place
3. Adding a review
4. Displaying a list of places

- Identify interactions between the client, API, business logic, and database.
- Detail requests and responses at each step.
- Add an explanation for each diagram.

### 3.1. User Registration

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant API
    participant BusinessLogic
    participant Database

    User->>API: POST /register
    API->>BusinessLogic: Validate & Process Request
    BusinessLogic->>Database: Save User Data
    Database-->>BusinessLogic: Confirmation
    BusinessLogic-->>API: Return Response
    API-->>User: Success/Failure Response
```

### 3.2. Creation of a Place

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant API
    participant BusinessLogic
    participant Database

    User->>API: POST /places
    API->>BusinessLogic: Validate & Process Request
    BusinessLogic->>Database: Save Place Data
    Database-->>BusinessLogic: Confirmation
    BusinessLogic-->>API: Return Response
    API-->>User: Success/Failure Response
```

### 3.3. Adding a Review

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant API
    participant BusinessLogic
    participant Database

    User->>API: POST /reviews
    API->>BusinessLogic: Validate & Process Request
    BusinessLogic->>Database: Save Review Data
    Database-->>BusinessLogic: Confirmation
    BusinessLogic-->>API: Return Response
    API-->>User: Success/Failure Response
```

### 3.4. Displaying a List of Places

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant API
    participant BusinessLogic
    participant Database

    User->>API: GET /places
    API->>BusinessLogic: Retrieve Places
    BusinessLogic->>Database: Query Places
    Database-->>BusinessLogic: Return Data
    BusinessLogic-->>API: Return Processed Data
    API-->>User: List of Places
```

---

## 4. Documentation Compilation

ðŸ“Œ **Objective**: Gather all diagrams and explanations into a structured and professional document.

âœ… **To Do**:

- **Introduction**: Project presentation and documentation objectives.
- **General Architecture**: High-level diagram + explanation.
- **Business Logic**: Class diagram + explanation of entities and relationships.
- **API Interaction Flow**: Sequence diagrams + explanation of API functionality.
- **Review and Formatting** (PDF/Word).

ðŸ“Œ **Key Points to Follow**:

âœ” Use UML to ensure clarity and standardization.
âœ” Maintain consistency in names and relationships between entities.
âœ” Use tools like Mermaid.js, draw.io for diagrams.
âœ” Verify the logic of interactions and document readability.

ðŸ”Ž **Final Goal**: Obtain a complete and precise technical documentation to guide the development of HBnB Evolution. ðŸš€

# Technical Documentation - HBnB Evolution

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed technical documentation for the HBnB Evolution project, a simplified application inspired by Airbnb. The goal is to define the system's architecture, design, and interactions to guide application development.

---

## 1. High-Level Architecture

The application follows a three-layer architecture with the **Facade** design pattern to simplify interactions between layers.

### 1.1. Layer Overview

- **Presentation Layer**: Provides services and APIs allowing users to interact with the system.
- **Business Layer**: Contains business logic and the main entity models.
- **Persistence Layer**: Responsible for data storage and retrieval.

### 1.2. Package Diagram (Mermaid.js)

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class PresentationLayer {
        <<Interface>>
        +ServiceAPI
    }
    class BusinessLogicLayer {
        +ModelClasses
    }
    class PersistenceLayer {
        +DatabaseAccess
    }

    PresentationLayer --> BusinessLogicLayer : Facade Pattern
    BusinessLogicLayer --> PersistenceLayer : Database Operations
```

---

## 2. Class Diagram - Business Layer

The class diagram details the entities and their relationships in the business layer.

### 2.1. Main Entities

- **User**: Represents a user with attributes like first name, last name, email, and password. Can be an administrator.
- **Place**: Represents a location with information such as title, description, price, latitude, and longitude.
- **Review**: Contains user evaluations with a rating and comment.
- **Amenity**: Represents an amenity that can be associated with a place.

### 2.2. UML Diagram (Mermaid.js)

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        +UUID id
        +String firstName
        +String lastName
        +String email
        +String password
        +Boolean isAdmin
        +Date createdAt
        +Date updatedAt
        +register()
        +updateProfile()
        +deleteAccount()
    }

    class Place {
        +UUID id
        +String title
        +String description
        +Float price
        +Float latitude
        +Float longitude
        +Date createdAt
        +Date updatedAt
        +User owner
        +List~Amenity~ amenities
        +createPlace()
        +updatePlace()
        +deletePlace()
    }
```
